Outline of the project to be submitted by Wednesday
Game Title: Word Wrangler
Game Description: A number of letters appear on the screen surrounding a text box, where a user types a word consisted of 2 or more of those letters.
To submit the word, the user presses the 'Space' bar. Correct answers result in the increment of points depending on the difficulty of the word,
while the converse results in the loss of health. The game ends when the health bar reaches 0.

Possible classes:
- Runner
- Player (keeps track of the health and points)
- Dictionary (reads a text file with a list of English words to decide if a given word is valid)
- DisplayText (parent class for all visible text objects such as the letters and the word)
  * Letter (inherits from DisplayText, one instance for each of the 4 or more letter options)
- WordGame (extends Canvas, called by Runner, implements main game logic)
- KeyListener (used to record key presses, maybe mouse clicks)
